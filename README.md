# Reputation DAO – Project Concept & Applications

## What This Is

Reputation DAO is a soulbound, on-chain reputation system built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) using Motoko.

### 🎯 Goal:

Create a transparent, tamper-proof trust layer that lets any community issue, track, and manage reputation points.

## 🧠 The Core Idea

* Members earn reputation points for contributing value (good actions, reliable work, provable impact) as defined by each organization.

* Reputation points are **non-transferable ("soulbound")** — they stay attached to the wallet/identity that earned them.

* In case a wallet is lost or compromised, the system offers **optional recovery logic**.

* To ensure relevance over time, reputation includes a **freshness factor**:

  ```
  repWeight = baseRep * freshnessFactor
  ```

* All activity is **fully on-chain**, verifiable by anyone.

## Quickstart

## 1 initialize backend 

--> get your plug principal id 
--> paste that plug id in main.mo like shown below 

```bash
stable var owner : Principal = Principal.fromText("<your-principal-id>"); 
```

```bash
# Start local replica
$ dfx start --background --clean 

# Deploy canister
$ dfx deploy --network playground

```
ps : this playground will only host the backend for 20 mins

## 2 modify frontend

copy the canister id generated by playground 

```bash
Reserved canister 'reputation_dao' with id 2uurk-ziaaa-aaaab-qacla-cai with the playground.
```
--> paste this canister id inside frontend/src/components/canister/reputationDao.ts as canisterid

## 3

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

See main.mo for method docs and logic.


## 🔎 Why Build This?

In many communities, trust is:

* Scattered
* Unverifiable
* Centralized

**Reputation DAO makes trust on-chain**: open, auditable, transparent, and portable.

# 🔄 Key Application Flows

This section outlines how Reputation DAO functions in four distinct domains.

---

## 1. 🌐 Online Communities

**Use Case**: Reward meaningful posts, helpful replies, and verified contributions.

### Actors:

* **User**: Posts or contributes content.
* **Moderator (Admin)**: Authorized to mint reputation.
* **Reputation DAO Canister**: Manages on-chain data.

### Flow:

```text
1. User submits a helpful post.
2. Moderator reviews and approves.
3. Moderator calls:
   awardRep(userPrincipal, 5, "Helpful reply in #tech-support thread")
4. Canister validates and records it.
5. User’s reputation updates publicly.
```

---

## 2. 💼 Professional Networks

**Use Case**: Freelancers and teams earn rep for task completion; clients can verify credibility.

### Actors:

* **Freelancer**: Completes work.
* **Client (Admin)**: Awards rep after task verification.
* **Frontend Platform**: Interfaces with DAO.

### Flow:

```text
1. Freelancer completes a task.
2. Client verifies and calls:
   awardRep(freelancerWallet, 10, "Landing page completed on time")
3. Canister updates reputation.
4. Future clients check rep via getBalance().
```

---

## 3. 🧑‍💻 Open Source & DAOs

**Use Case**: Contributors earn rep for PRs, bounties, and governance participation.

### Actors:

* **Contributor**: Completes contributions.
* **Maintainer / DAO Admin**: Awards or revokes rep.
* **DAO Frontend**: Uses rep for governance/voting.

### Flow:

```text
1. Contributor merges PR.
2. Maintainer calls:
   awardRep(contributorPrincipal, 20, "Smart contract PR merged")
3. Reputation updated and recorded.
4. Used in DAO voting.
5. Abuse handled by:
   revokeRep(contributorPrincipal, 20, "PR flagged as plagiarized")
```

---

## 4. 🎓 Education & Credentials

**Use Case**: Reputation acts as a verified skills badge or learning progress indicator.

### Actors:

* **Student**: Completes a course or task.
* **Instructor (Admin)**: Verifies and awards rep.
* **LMS/Frontend**: Displays credentials.

### Flow:

```text
1. Student finishes module.
2. Instructor awards:
   awardRep(studentPrincipal, 15, "Completed Blockchain Basics Module")
3. Rep shown on student profile.
4. Recruiters verify via getBalance().
5. Tags (e.g., "blockchain", "frontend") categorize achievements.
```

---

# 📜 Key Rules

* **Soulbound**: Reputation cannot be transferred.
* **Controlled Minting**: Only trusted awarders (e.g., HR manager, team lead) can assign rep.
* **Daily Mint Limits**: Prevent abuse and inflation.
* **System Revocation**: Admins/system can revoke fake or farmed rep.
* **Public Ledger**: All actions are visible and verifiable.

---

# ⚙️ Technical Design

### ✅ Smart Contract (Canister)

* Written in **Motoko**
* Stores balances, award logs, daily mint limits

### 🛠️ Core Methods:

```ts
awardRep(user: Principal, amount: Nat, reason: Text)
revokeRep(user: Principal, amount: Nat, reason: Text)
getBalance(user: Principal): Nat
getAwardHistory(user: Principal): [AwardLog]
```

### 🖥️ Frontend:

* Web/mobile compatible
* No gas fees for users — backend handles all transactions

### 🧩 Integration:

* Other dApps or DAOs can fetch rep to:

  * Gate access
  * Modify privileges
  * Weight votes

---

# 🚀 Benefits

* Tamper-proof trust system
* Transparent and verifiable
* Portable across ecosystems
* Fully on-chain and decentralized
* Modular: Easy to extend with perks, tags, or categories

---

# 🧑‍💻 Next Steps for Devs

1. Build Motoko canister
2. Deploy to ICP testnet → then mainnet
3. Connect to any frontend/bot
4. Implement/test award + revoke + balance logic
5. Prepare:

   * Open-source repo
   * MIT/Apache license
   * README + demo video

---

# ✅ Hackathon Deliverables

* [] `main.mo` + `dfx.json` (Deployed Canister)
* [] Clear Documentation
* [] Demo Video (Award/Revoke flow)
* [] Defined Rules for Minting, Revoking, Usage

---

# 🧭 Final Summary

**Reputation DAO** is a modular, transparent, and secure **reputation framework** for communities, teams, and decentralized organizations.

Built on the ICP stack with Motoko, it transforms human contribution into **on-chain credibility** that can’t be bought, sold, or faked.
